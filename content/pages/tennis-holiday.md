# Tennis Holidays

## About

> My Dad and I have run St. Lucia Tennis holidays for Oshawa Tennis Club
> players, their friends and other Durham region players for the last 3 years.
> The idea behind the tennis holiday was to give a unique tour of St. Lucia with
> my dad and myself who grew up on the island.  This is a a different holiday from what
> you would normally experience at an all inclusive hotel vacation. We stayed at
> the beautiful Landings Hotel resort St. Lucia the last 3 years and the trips
> have left the members with a lifetime memory.  
>
> Although a disappointment that we are not returning to St. Lucia in 2016, we
> thought a different venue would be a fashionable choice.  We are going on our
> first Antigua Tennis Holiday 2016. We have friends in Antigua and have played
> there in many tennis tournaments over the years. We are staying at the St.
> James Club Antigua. The resort has four tennis courts, which will accommodate
> 20-24 tennis players; however, non tennis players are always welcome to
> experience the trip with us.  We are excited to announce that the Antigua trip
> 2016 is FULL with, 22 tennis players and 29 total travellers. WOW!  An
> additional 2016 tennis holiday may be considered for late September this year
> depending on numbers.  This is our fourth Tennis Holiday and each year we have
> seen the numbers increase, so if interested in September, please contact
> me. You must be an intermediate level player or better to come on the trip. If
> you are unsure of your level, please contact us by email at
> `kaneeastertennis@gmail.com` or `john@johneaster.com`.
