# Tennis Holidays

## About
---------

My Dad and I have run St. Lucia Tennis holidays for Oshawa Tennis Club players,
their friends and other Durham region players for the last 4 years. The idea
behind the tennis holiday was to give a unique tour of St. Lucia with my dad
and myself who grew up on the island. This is a different holiday from what you
would normally experience at an all inclusive hotel vacation. We stayed at the
beautiful Landings Hotel resort in St. Lucia the first three years and the
trips left the members with a lifetime memory.

We thought a different venue would be a fashionable choice for our fourth year,
so we visited St. James Club Antigua for 2016. The Antigua trip 2016 was FULL
with, 22 tennis players and 29 total travellers. WOW!

For 2017 we are returning to our homeland of St. Lucia to stay at St. James
Club Morgan Bay. The dates will be **April 2nd to April 9th, 2017**. This will be
our fifth Tennis Holiday and each year we have seen the numbers increase, so if
interested for April, please contact me. You must be an intermediate level
player or better to come on the trip. If you are unsure of your level, please
contact us by email at `kaneeastertennis@gmail.com` or `john@johneaster.com`.
